## ToDo

- [x] `references` should not contain what is used by `delim`
- [x] `references` can't exist twice in the tree
- [ ] Same `reference` can't match two different xpath ? (should not happen I guess)
- [ ] Same XPath should not exist twice in the CiteStructure ?
- [ ] Same XPath at the same level / same delim ?
